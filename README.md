# React + Vite

Todo List App-Raect
This React application allows users to manage their todos. It consists of two main components: Input and Card.

input Component
This component provides an interface for users to input new todos or edit existing ones. It consists of input fields for todo title and description, as well as buttons for adding new todos or saving edited todos.

Card Component
This component is used for displaying a list of todos in a card format. It provides functionality to filter todos based on their status, edit or delete todos, and update their status.
This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
